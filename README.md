Known Issues:
[done]- Need a background-div that can be clicked on so we could set active to be false

- We could move the linkedList processing to the backend, and then use Socket.io to transfer data for quicker processing. 

- as of now, we are doing a recursive call everytime a user enters a letter....this can GREATLY be optimized.

- stylings

MISSING:

- trouble deleting the first character

- output prints weird

- refactor

- if you scroll all the way to the left to try and delete the first value... not working right now
	** need a gate for it

- Once you get to the bottom, the screen doesn't resize appropriately **
