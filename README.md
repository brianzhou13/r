Known Issues:
[done]- Need a background-div that can be clicked on so we could set active to be false

- We could move the linkedList processing to the backend, and then use Socket.io to transfer data for quicker processing. 

- as of now, we are doing a recursive call everytime a user enters a letter....
	- this can GREATLY be optimized...
