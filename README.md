Known Issues:
[done]- Need a background-div that can be clicked on so we could set active to be false

- We could move the linkedList processing to the backend, and then use Socket.io to transfer data for quicker processing. 

- as of now, we are doing a recursive call everytime a user enters a letter....this can GREATLY be optimized.

- possible solutions: have a 'all_Values' property that we can store 
	- everytime a removeNode / insertNode is called, we update 

- cycle down

- display all previous items entered

- stylings

- insert

MISSING:

- trouble deleting the first character

- output prints weird

- refactor
